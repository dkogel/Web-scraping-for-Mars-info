# web-scraping-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to practice web scraping and storing the data found in a noSQL database. Data is collected using Splinter and BeautifulSoup to pull the most up to date information and images from mulitple websites dedicated to the planet Mars, and once collected it is uploaded to a MongoDB database named `mars_info` using Flask. That updated information is then rendered to a website from that database, again using Flask as well as Jinja2 templates. The website itself uses Boostrap for it's styling.
